# What I Learned From the Best Manager I’ve Ever Had

I’ve worked with many managers in my career. Some were competent. Some were brilliant. Some simply managed to keep the team alive.

But only once did I work under someone who **permanently reshaped how I think about leadership** — someone whose behavior, habits, and mindset quietly modeled the kind of leader I aspire to be.

At the time, I didn’t realize it. I just felt… supported. Understood. Challenged. Trusted. Looking back, I now see that his approach wasn’t accidental — it was **exceptional leadership in action**.


## Confidence Before Competence

Early in my career, I often faced situations where I **didn’t fully understand the technology or problem** at hand. At times, I felt paralyzed by doubt and I remember thinking, *“Maybe I’m not cut out for this.”*

He never dismissed that feeling, but he never let it define me either.

* He would say: “You can do this. Here’s a starting point.”
* If needed, he would share references, documents, or links to help me quickly gain enough understanding to begin.
* He trusted that **I could learn and adapt**, even when I didn’t yet feel ready.

This approach had a subtle but powerful effect: **I learned to tackle unfamiliar technologies and challenges without fear**. It wasn’t reckless confidence; it was professional courage — confidence built on competence, not assumption.

*Lesson:* Great managers give you enough support to start, but enough space to grow.


## Humans, Not Resources

Sometimes, personal life challenges affected my work.

Most managers would ignore this, or worse, treat it as a performance problem. Not him.

* He listened — without judgment.
* Offered advice when appropriate, like a trusted friend.
* Maintained professional boundaries while acknowledging that life and work are intertwined.

I still remember one moment when a personal challenge was weighing on me, and just talking to him helped me think clearly again.

*Lesson:* Emotional intelligence in leadership is not optional; it is foundational.


## Safe Space for Ideas

I’ve always been curious, sometimes bringing ideas that were half-formed or ambitious.

He never shut ideas down. Instead:

* He discussed them logically.
* Broke them down into smaller experiments.
* Focused on **viable ways to test and validate** instead of building a full solution blindly.

I remember feeling encouraged to experiment even when I wasn’t sure the idea would work. This approach allowed me to pursue projects like **open-source integration automation**, which became one of my most meaningful accomplishments.

*Lesson:* Protecting curiosity and testing ideas methodically drives innovation and builds trust.


## Polishing Work Without Taking Credit

Whenever I completed any prototype project, or first accomplishment, he wouldn’t just say “good job.” He would:

* Guide me to refine the work for broader visibility.
* Suggest improvements to make it presentable to leadership or external stakeholders.
* Highlight my contribution publicly, **never taking credit for himself**.

He also advocated for recognition when deserved, including negotiating awards or bonuses for me without making promises he couldn’t keep.

*Lesson:* Leadership amplifies the team, not the manager. True recognition is **earned, communicated, and followed through**.


## Recognition as Responsibility

One particular incident illustrates this perfectly:

A customer once praised my technical support work. My manager called me and said:

> “I’ll try to convince the director to award you a bonus, but I can’t promise anything.”

Months later, I received a “Best Technical Support” award shield and later, a bonus.

What stayed with me wasn’t the reward itself, but how he **advocated upward while managing expectations honestly**. He didn’t overpromise, yet he delivered.

*Lesson:* Recognition is a responsibility, not generosity.


## Leadership Through Automation

He was deeply technical and applied that mindset to management itself:

* Automated repetitive tasks, such as weekly status reports, using Jira APIs.
* Reduced friction and wasted effort, allowing the team to focus on meaningful work.
* Treated management tasks as processes to optimize, not just chores to endure.

*Lesson:* Great managers reduce friction and streamline systems, freeing teams to achieve more.


## Transformative Leadership in Practice

For me, he became the kind of leader who transforms a confidence-shaken engineer into someone willing to take on unfamiliar technologies and complex challenges — professionally, methodically, and without fear.

Even without a formal title, working under him permanently shaped how I:

* Mentor and guide others.
* Give constructive feedback.
* Approach responsibility with integrity.
* Advocate for recognition and fairness.

I still catch myself thinking, *“What would he do here?”* when faced with a new challenge. That’s how deeply his example influenced me.

*Lesson:* Habits form earlier than titles. Leadership is modeled, not assigned.


## Takeaways for Aspiring Leaders

From confidence-building to recognition, curiosity, advocacy, and process optimization, his approach taught me that leadership is:

1. Building confidence before competence.
2. Treating team members as humans, not resources.
3. Amplifying team success rather than your own.
4. Protecting and validating ideas, even imperfect ones.
5. Advocating upward honestly and following through.
6. Reducing friction through systems thinking.
7. Modeling the behavior you want to see in others.

These aren’t just lessons for managers; they’re habits I strive to practice every day. Titles may come later, but **the mindset starts now**.
